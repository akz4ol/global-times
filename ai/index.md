## Editorial Approach

The AI Hub operates on principles of **aggregation, synthesis, and attribution**:

1. **Aggregation**: We systematically monitor primary sources across the AI ecosystem
2. **Synthesis**: Complex developments are contextualized for accessibility without sacrificing accuracy
3. **Attribution**: All coverage links to original sources for verification and deeper exploration
4. **Timeliness**: Focus on developments within 24-72 hours, with ongoing tracking of evolving stories

This section employs AI-assisted content generation. We do not conduct original reporting or independent verification. Readers should consult primary sources for consequential decisions.
