title: AI Ethics & Safety
subtitle: Alignment Research, Societal Impact & Responsible Development
---

The Ethics & Safety section examines the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems. We cover alignment research, bias investigations, societal impact assessments, and the evolving frameworks for ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and safe.

## Coverage Domains

### AI Safety & Alignment

| Research Area | Description | Key Questions |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Alignment** | Ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals | How do we specify human values? How do we verify alignment? |
| **Interpretability** | Understanding model decision-making | Can we explain why models produce specific outputs? |
| **Robustness** | Reliable behavior under distribution shift | How do systems behave on out-of-distribution inputs? |
| **Scalable Oversight** | Human supervision of capable systems | How do we oversee AI that exceeds human capability in domains? |
| **Governance** | Institutional structures for AI safety | What organizational practices reduce catastrophic risk? |

### Bias & Fairness

| Issue | Manifestation | Mitigation Approaches |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Training Data Bias** | Historical inequities encoded in datasets | Balanced datasets, debiasing techniques |
| **Representation Harm** | Stereotyping, erasure in model outputs | Diverse evaluation, red-teaming |
| **Allocation Harm** | Discriminatory resource/opportunity distribution | Algorithmic audits, fairness constraints |
| **Evaluation Gaps** | Underperformance on marginalized groups | Disaggregated evaluation, inclusive benchmarks |

### Societal Impact

| Domain | Concerns | Considerations |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Labor & Employment** | Job displacement, skill transformation | Workforce transition, education adaptation |
| **Information Ecosystem** | Misinformation, synthetic media | Detection tools, provenance standards |
| **Power Concentration** | Resource requirements favoring incumbents | Compute access, open research |
| **Privacy** | Training data, inference privacy | Data rights, confidential computing |
| **Environmental** | Energy consumption, carbon footprint | Efficiency research, renewable compute |

## Coverage Approach

Our ethics and safety coverage emphasizes:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Precise representation of alignment and safety research
2. **Nuance**: Avoid simplistic narratives about AI risk or benefit
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Include researcher, industry, civil society, and affected community viewpoints
4. **Evidence-Based**: Ground claims in research findings and documented incidents
5. **Constructive Focus**: Highlight solutions alongside problems
