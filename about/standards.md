## AI-Assisted Content Generation

Our articles are created with the assistance of large language models (LLMs). This means:

1. **Content is synthesized, not reported.** We do not conduct interviews, attend events, or perform original investigative journalism.

2. **Information comes from training data and public sources.** AI systems draw on their training data and publicly available information to generate content.

3. **Human oversight is applied.** Content is reviewed before publication, but errors may still occur.

4. **AI can make mistakes.** Language models can generate incorrect information, misattribute sources, or present outdated facts. This is sometimes called "hallucination."

## What This Means for Readers

| Action | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Verify important information** | Do not rely solely on our content for decisions affecting your health, finances, legal matters, or safety |
| **Check primary sources** | When we reference studies, reports, or statements, verify them independently |
| **Consider the date** | Information may become outdated. AI training data has cutoff dates |
| **Read critically** | Apply the same skepticism you would to any media source |

## Content Categories

### Analysis & Commentary
Most of our content falls into this category. We synthesize publicly available information to provide perspective on topics of general interest. This is opinion and analysis, not news reporting.

### Explainers
We create educational content explaining complex topics. While we strive for accuracy, these should be starting points for understanding, not definitive references.

### Aggregation
We may summarize or aggregate information from multiple sources. We do not claim original reporting.

## What We Do NOT Do

- **Original reporting** — We do not have reporters in the field
- **Interviews** — We do not conduct interviews with sources
- **Fact-checking in the journalistic sense** — We do not verify claims through direct investigation
- **Breaking news** — We do not cover live events or developing stories
- **Confidential sources** — We do not receive or protect confidential information

---

## Verification Standards

When we present factual claims, we aim to indicate confidence levels:

| Level | Meaning | Reader Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **High Confidence** | Information appears in multiple reliable sources | Verify if consequential |
| **Medium Confidence** | Limited sourcing or complexity | Verify before relying |
| **Analysis/Opinion** | Our interpretation of available information | Evaluate critically |
| **Developing** | Situation is evolving, facts may change | Check current sources |

**Important:** These are internal guidelines, not guarantees. We may still make errors.

## Corrections Policy

If we become aware of errors:
- We will correct them when possible
- Significant corrections will be noted
- We cannot guarantee all errors will be caught

To report an error, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akz4ol/global-times).

## Sources

We draw on publicly available information including:
- News reports from established outlets
- Academic research and publications
- Government and institutional reports
- Expert commentary and analysis

We do not have special access to information. We synthesize what is publicly available.

## Limitations of AI

Readers should understand that AI systems:

- Can generate plausible-sounding false information
- May reflect biases present in training data
- Cannot verify information in real-time
- May present outdated information as current
- Cannot exercise human judgment about ethics or sensitivity
- May misunderstand context or nuance

---

## Our Commitment

We are transparent about what we are and are not. We believe AI can assist in information delivery, but we do not claim to replace professional journalism.

We encourage readers to:

1. Support established news organizations
2. Develop media literacy skills
3. Verify important information from multiple sources
4. Engage critically with all media, including ours
