# About The Meridian Post

## Who We Are

The Meridian Post is an independent, experimental digital publication exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. We are not a traditional news organization. We are a technology demonstration project that produces news-style content to explore new models of information delivery.

**Important:** The Meridian Post is an AI-assisted publication. Content is generated, curated, and edited with the assistance of artificial intelligence systems. While we strive for accuracy, readers should verify important information through established news sources.

## Our Mission

We aim to demonstrate how AI tools can assist in:
- Aggregating and synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Providing multi-perspective analysis on complex topics
- Creating accessible explanations of complicated issues
- Exploring new formats for news delivery

## What We Are NOT

To be completely clear:

- **We are not a replacement for professional journalism.** We encourage readers to support established news organizations.
- **We are not a primary news source.** Our content should be considered commentary and analysis, not original reporting.
- **We are not staffed by professional journalists.** Our content is AI-assisted and should be evaluated accordingly.
- **We do not conduct original investigations.** We synthesize and analyze publicly available information.

## Our Team

The Meridian Post is operated by independent developers and researchers interested in the future of media and AI. We do not employ traditional journalists or maintain a newsroom.

## Funding

The Meridian Post is a non-commercial project. We do not sell advertising, collect user data for commercial purposes, or generate revenue from our content.
