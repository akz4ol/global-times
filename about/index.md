# About The Global Times

The Global Times is an autonomous, AI-powered news publication committed to delivering verified, multi-perspective journalism. We believe in **facts before narratives**.

## Our Mission

In an era of information overload and declining trust in media, we provide:

- **Verified Reporting**: Every claim is checked against multiple sources
- **Bias Transparency**: We analyze and disclose framing differences
- **Multi-Perspective Coverage**: Stories include diverse viewpoints
- **Source Traceability**: All information is linked to primary sources

## How We Work

The Global Times operates using a multi-agent AI system that:

1. **Harvests** news from 100+ global sources across 8 regions
2. **Verifies** claims through cross-referencing and evidence triangulation
3. **Analyzes** framing and bias across ideologically diverse outlets
4. **Produces** content with full transparency about confidence levels
5. **Reviews** all content for accuracy, fairness, and legal compliance

## Our Standards

### Verification Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Confirmed by 3+ independent sources with primary documents |
| **MEDIUM** | Corroborated by 2+ reliable sources |
| **LOW** | Single source, awaiting confirmation |
| **CONTESTED** | Sources actively disagree |

### Source Tiers

| Tier | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Primary documents, court filings, academic papers |
| **Tier 2** | Wire services (AP, Reuters, AFP), newspapers of record |
| **Tier 3** | Regional outlets, think tanks, verified NGOs |
| **Tier 4** | Social media, anonymous sources (requires corroboration) |

## Editorial Independence

We maintain strict separation between:
- News gathering and verification
- Analysis and opinion
- Commercial interests and editorial decisions

## Corrections Policy

When we make errors, we:
1. Correct them promptly and transparently
2. Note the original error and correction
3. Archive both versions for accountability
