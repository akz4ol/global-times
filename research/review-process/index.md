subtitle: How Agentic Review Works
---

## Overview

The MeridAIn Research Review uses a multi-agent AI system to evaluate submissions. This is an **experimental process** that differs fundamentally from traditional peer review.

---

## The Four Stages

### Stage 1: Automated Screening

Initial automated checks for:
- Format compliance
- Plagiarism detection
- Scope assessment
- Basic quality gates

**Timeline**: 1-3 days

---

### Stage 2: Agentic Review Panel

Four specialized AI agents evaluate the submission in parallel:

| Agent | Focus Areas |
|-------|-------------|
| **Technical Agent** | Methodology, validity, reproducibility, accuracy |
| **Domain Agent** | Novelty, contribution, literature, evidence |
| **Ethics Agent** | Ethical compliance, misuse risk, bias, impact |
| **Clarity Agent** | Writing, figures, accessibility, organization |

Each agent produces:
- Scores on relevant dimensions (1-5)
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Questions for authors
- Recommendation (accept/revise/reject)

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Stage 3: Synthesis & Decision

A meta-review agent:
- Aggregates all agent reviews
- Identifies consensus and disagreements
- Weights recommendations
- Produces consolidated feedback
- Makes final recommendation

**Possible Outcomes**:
- **Accept**: Paper ready for publication
- **Minor Revision**: Small changes needed
- **Major Revision**: Significant changes needed
- **Reject**: Does not meet standards

---

### Stage 4: Author Response

If revision requested:
1. Authors receive consolidated feedback
2. Authors submit revised manuscript
3. Authors provide point-by-point response
4. Changes evaluated by agents
5. Final decision rendered

## Review Dimensions

### Technical Review
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Methodology | Soundness of approach |
| Validity | Mathematical/statistical correctness |
| Reproducibility | Can results be reproduced? |
| Accuracy | Technical claims supported? |

### Domain Review
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Novelty | New contribution to field |
| Significance | Importance of contribution |
| Literature | Coverage of related work |
| Evidence | Claims supported by evidence |

### Ethics Review
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Compliance | Ethical guidelines followed |
| Misuse Risk | Potential for harmful use |
| Bias | Fairness considerations |
| Impact | Societal implications |

### Clarity Review
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Writing | Quality and readability |
| Figures | Clarity of visuals |
| Reproducibility | Can methods be followed? |
| Accessibility | Understandable to audience |

## Transparency

All accepted papers include:
- Full reviews from all agents
- Scores on all dimensions
- Author responses to feedback
- Decision rationale

---

## Important Limitations

### What Agentic Review Is
- AI-assisted evaluation using language models
- Systematic application of review criteria
- Rapid, consistent feedback

### What Agentic Review Is NOT
- Human expert evaluation
- Domain-specific expertise
- Guarantee of correctness
- Replacement for traditional peer review

### Known Limitations
- AI may miss subtle errors
- Cannot verify empirical claims
- May not catch all ethical issues
- Limited by training data knowledge
- Cannot fully assess novelty in rapidly moving fields

---

## Why We Do This

We believe AI can assist in academic review by:
- Providing rapid, consistent feedback
- Checking for common issues
- Improving accessibility of review
- Experimenting with new models

We are transparent about limitations and encourage authors to seek additional feedback from human experts.
