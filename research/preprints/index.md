title: Preprints & Working Papers
subtitle: Early-Stage Research Seeking Community Feedback
---

The MeridAIn Research Review preprint server hosts early-stage research prior to formal peer review. Preprints enable rapid dissemination, community feedback, and iterative refinement of work before authors pursue formal publication—either through MRR's agentic review process or traditional venues.

---

## What Are Preprints?

Preprints are preliminary versions of research papers shared before undergoing formal peer review. They serve several purposes in the research ecosystem:

| Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Rapid Dissemination** | Share findings immediately without waiting for review cycles |
| **Priority Establishment** | Timestamp discoveries before formal publication |
| **Community Feedback** | Receive input from the broader research community |
| **Iterative Improvement** | Refine work based on early feedback |
| **Open Science** | Increase transparency and accessibility of research |

---

## Preprint Categories

| Category | Description | Typical Content |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Early Research** | Initial findings, preliminary results | Novel observations, proof-of-concept |
| **Extended Abstracts** | Compressed versions of larger work | Key findings, method summaries |
| **Negative Results** | Failed experiments, null findings | Important for reproducibility |
| **Reproductions** | Replication attempts of published work | Confirmation or contradiction |
| **Methods & Tools** | Technical contributions | Software, datasets, techniques |
| **Position Papers** | Preliminary arguments | Early-stage thinking, proposals |

## Posting a Preprint

### Screening Process

Preprints receive light-touch screening (not full review):

| Check | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Format Compliance** | Meets basic formatting requirements |
| **Scope Alignment** | Relevant to AI/ML research domains |
| **Minimum Quality** | Coherent, professionally presented |
| **Legal/Ethics** | No obvious harmful content or violations |

Screening is typically completed within 1-3 days.

### What Screening Does NOT Assess

| Excluded | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **Technical Correctness** | Requires full review |
| **Novelty** | Subjective, context-dependent |
| **Significance** | Community determines value |
| **Reproducibility** | Cannot be verified without review |

## From Preprint to Publication

### Pathway to Formal Review

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1. Post Preprint** | Share early-stage work |
| **2. Collect Feedback** | Receive community input |
| **3. Revise** | Improve based on feedback |
| **4. Submit for Review** | Request full agentic review |
| **5. Peer Review** | Complete multi-agent evaluation |
| **6. Publication** | Upon acceptance, move to Published Papers |

### Dual Submission

| Venue | Policy |
|-------|--------|
| **MRR Preprint → MRR Publication** | Encouraged, streamlined process |
| **MRR Preprint → Traditional Venue** | Permitted; check venue's preprint policy |
| **Traditional Venue → MRR Preprint** | Verify original venue allows preprints |

## Community Engagement

### Providing Feedback

Community members are encouraged to provide constructive feedback on preprints:

| Feedback Type | Mechanism |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Technical Comments** | GitHub Issues linked to preprint |
| **Error Reports** | Formal notification to authors |
| **Questions** | Direct engagement via Issues |
| **Discussion** | Community threads |

### Feedback Guidelines

We encourage feedback that is:
- **Constructive**: Aimed at improving the work
- **Specific**: Identifies exact concerns or suggestions
- **Respectful**: Professional and collegial
- **Actionable**: Authors can respond to the input

## Important Disclaimers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Not Peer Reviewed** | Preprints have not undergone formal review. May contain errors or incomplete analysis. |
| **Evaluate Critically** | Apply appropriate skepticism. Preliminary findings often do not survive scrutiny. |
| **Cite Appropriately** | Clearly identify preprints as such. Do not treat as established findings. |
| **Liability** | Authors bear full responsibility. MRR provides hosting, not validation. |
