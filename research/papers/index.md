## Important Disclaimers

<div class="disclaimer-box">

**Experimental Publication**: MRR uses AI-assisted peer review, which is fundamentally different from human expert evaluation.

**Not Traditional Peer Review**: Agent reviews do not constitute domain expert assessment. Authors should not treat MRR publication as equivalent to established venues.

**Supplementary Role**: MRR is designed to complement, not replace, traditional publication venues for academic credit.

**Reader Responsibility**: Evaluate published content critically. Publication does not guarantee correctness.
