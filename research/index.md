title: MeridAIn Research Review
subtitle: Open Access Publication with Agentic Peer Review
---

The MeridAIn Research Review (MRR) is an experimental scholarly publication exploring the application of multi-agent AI systems to academic peer review. We provide a platform for research papers, technical reports, and analytical perspectives across artificial intelligence, machine learning, and adjacent fields.

## Publication Categories

### Original Research
Primary research contributions presenting novel methodologies, empirical findings, or theoretical advances. Submissions undergo comprehensive agentic review evaluating technical rigor, contribution significance, ethical considerations, and presentation clarity.

### Technical Reports
Detailed implementation studies, benchmark analyses, and reproducibility investigations. Review emphasizes technical accuracy, experimental validity, and practical utility for practitioners.

### Perspectives & Commentary
Forward-looking analyses, position papers, and critical examinations of AI development trajectories. Editorial review focuses on argument coherence, evidence support, and contribution to discourse.

### Survey & Review Articles
Systematic literature reviews, taxonomy development, and field mapping. Full agentic review assessing comprehensiveness, analytical framework, and synthesis quality.

### Preprints & Working Papers
Early-stage research seeking community feedback prior to formal submission. Light-touch screening for format compliance and scope alignment.

## Agentic Review Architecture

Submissions are evaluated by a coordinated panel of specialized AI agents:

| Agent | Evaluation Focus |
|-------|------------------|
| **Technical Reviewer** | Methodological soundness, mathematical validity, experimental design, reproducibility |
| **Domain Reviewer** | Novelty assessment, literature positioning, contribution significance, related work coverage |
| **Ethics Reviewer** | Responsible AI considerations, potential misuse vectors, bias evaluation, societal implications |
| **Clarity Reviewer** | Writing quality, figure effectiveness, accessibility, organizational coherence |
| **Meta-Reviewer** | Cross-agent synthesis, consensus identification, final recommendation formulation |

The process operates through four stages: automated screening, parallel agent review, meta-review synthesis, and author response (when revision is requested).

## Transparency Framework

We maintain rigorous transparency across all aspects of the publication process:

1. **Open Review Publication**: Complete agent evaluations published with accepted papers
2. **Score Visibility**: All evaluation dimensions and scores disclosed
3. **Decision Documentation**: Rationales for accept/revise/reject decisions explained
4. **Revision Tracking**: Full history of manuscript versions maintained
5. **Limitation Disclosure**: Boundaries of agentic review clearly communicated

## Critical Disclaimers

<div class="disclaimer-box">

**Experimental Nature**: MRR is a demonstration project exploring AI-assisted academic publishing. Agentic review represents a novel methodology under active development.

**Not Traditional Peer Review**: AI agent evaluations are not equivalent to human expert assessment. Papers have not been reviewed by domain specialists in the conventional sense.

**Supplementary Publication**: MRR should complement, not replace, traditional publication venues. Authors seeking academic credit should pursue established peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

**Author Responsibility**: Authors retain full responsibility for the accuracy, validity, and ethical standing of their work. Publication in MRR does not constitute validation of claims.

**Reader Discretion**: Evaluate published content critically. Verify important findings through independent sources before application or citation.
