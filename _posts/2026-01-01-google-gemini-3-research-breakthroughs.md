2025 marked a year of extraordinary progress in AI research, with Google's Gemini 3 and Gemma 3 models leading advances in reasoning, multimodality, and efficiency. As the field enters 2026, AI's trajectory is shifting from tool to utility—and in some cases, to collaborative partner.

## Gemini 3: New State of the Art

Google's Gemini 3 achieved several significant milestones:

- **Topped the LMArena Leaderboard** with breakthrough scores on multiple benchmarks
- **Humanity's Last Exam**: Redefined multimodal reasoning capabilities
- **MathArena Apex**: Set a new state-of-the-art score of 23.4%, establishing new frontiers in mathematical reasoning
- Enhanced efficiency allowing deployment across more use cases

The Gemma 3 series of smaller models brought similar capabilities to more accessible scales, democratizing access to advanced AI reasoning.

## Healthcare Breakthroughs

AI-powered medical diagnostics saw remarkable progress:

**Alzheimer's Detection**: Researchers announced faster and cheaper diagnosis methods for Alzheimer's and related diseases. One study identified a specific gene as a cause of Alzheimer's—a discovery made possible because AI helped visualize the protein's three-dimensional structure.

**Heart Disease Diagnosis**: University of Michigan researchers developed an AI model capable of diagnosing coronary microvascular dysfunction using only a standard 10-second EKG strip, delivering accurate results within seconds.

**Drug Discovery**: Google released AlphaGenome to better understand diseases and accelerate drug discovery, enabled by technical advances allowing processing of long DNA sequences.

## Quantum Computing Milestone

Google achieved verifiable quantum advantage with results published on the cover of Nature. Their "Quantum Echoes" algorithm running on the Willow chip performed 13,000 times faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers.

## Hardware Innovation: 3D Chips

Researchers created a new 3D computer chip design that stacks memory and computing elements vertically, dramatically improving data movement inside the chip. Unlike traditional flat designs, this approach avoids the traffic jams that limit today's AI hardware. Prototypes already beat comparable chips by several times.

## Concerns About Research Quality

However, 2025 also raised concerns about AI's impact on scientific integrity. Studies found that AI writing tools are supercharging productivity—researchers posted up to 50% more papers after adopting them—but many AI-polished papers fail to deliver real scientific value. This growing gap between slick writing and meaningful results is complicating peer review and funding decisions.

## What Defines 2026

Looking ahead, several trends will shape AI research:

- **Post-training breakthroughs**: The biggest advances are now occurring after initial model training
- **Open-source proliferation**: Foundation model capabilities will no longer be limited to a handful of companies
- **AI-discovered drugs**: Several drug candidates discovered and optimized by AI reach mid-to-late-stage clinical trials
- **AI as partner**: The shift from AI as instrument to AI as collaborative partner accelerates
