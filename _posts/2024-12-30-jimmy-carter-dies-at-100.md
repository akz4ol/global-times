Former President Jimmy Carter, who served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981 and went on to become one of the most active and respected post-presidential figures in American history, died Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old.

Carter's death was confirmed by The Carter Center, the nonprofit organization he founded with his wife Rosalynn in 1982. He had been receiving hospice care at his home since February 2023.

## A Life of Service

James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, a small town where he would spend much of his life. After graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1946, he served as a submarine officer before returning to Georgia to take over the family peanut farming business following his father's death.

Carter entered politics in 1962, winning a seat in the Georgia State Senate. He served as Governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 before launching his successful presidential campaign.

## The Presidency

Carter defeated incumbent President Gerald Ford in 1976, running as a Washington outsider in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. His presidency was marked by significant achievements in foreign policy, including:

- **The Camp David Accords (1978)**: Carter brokered a historic peace agreement between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
- **The Panama Canal Treaties**: Agreements to transfer control of the canal to Panama
- **Normalization of relations with China**: Establishing formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China

However, his administration also faced significant challenges, including the Iran hostage crisis and economic difficulties marked by high inflation and energy shortages.

## Post-Presidential Legacy

After leaving the White House following his 1980 defeat to Ronald Reagan, Carter redefined what it meant to be a former president. Through The Carter Center, he and Rosalynn worked on:

- **Disease eradication**: Leading efforts to eliminate Guinea worm disease, reducing cases from millions to near-zero
- **Election monitoring**: Observing elections in more than 100 countries
- **Habitat for Humanity**: Personally building homes for those in need well into his 90s
- **Conflict resolution**: Mediating disputes and promoting human rights worldwide

In 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."

## Reactions

World leaders and former presidents offered tributes to Carter's life and legacy.

> "Jimmy Carter showed that there is life after the presidency, and that life can be one of profound meaning and impact." — Statement from The Carter Center

Carter is survived by his four children, numerous grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. His wife Rosalynn preceded him in death in November 2023, after 77 years of marriage.

A state funeral is expected to be held in Washington, D.C., with burial in Plains, Georgia.
