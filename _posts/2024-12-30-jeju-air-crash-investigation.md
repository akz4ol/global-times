South Korean investigators have begun examining the flight data and cockpit voice recorders from Jeju Air Flight 2216, which crashed upon landing at Muan International Airport on Sunday, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.

The Boeing 737-800, arriving from Bangkok, attempted an emergency belly landing after the landing gear reportedly failed to deploy. The aircraft overran the runway and struck a concrete barrier at the end of the runway before erupting in flames.

## What We Know

**The Timeline:**
- Flight 2216 departed Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on schedule
- Pilots reported a bird strike during approach
- Crew declared an emergency and attempted to land
- Landing gear failed to deploy
- Aircraft performed a belly landing but could not stop
- Plane struck a concrete structure and caught fire

**Casualties:**
- 179 fatalities confirmed
- 2 survivors, both crew members in critical condition
- 175 passengers were South Korean nationals
- 2 Thai nationals were aboard

## Investigation Focus

Investigators from South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board are examining several factors:

1. **Bird Strike**: The reported bird strike may have caused engine failure or damaged critical systems
2. **Landing Gear Malfunction**: Why the gear failed to deploy is a primary focus
3. **Runway Safety**: Questions about the concrete structure at the runway's end
4. **Weather Conditions**: Visibility and wind conditions at the time of landing

The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered within hours of the crash and are being analyzed.

## Response

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared a national mourning period and visited the crash site. The government has promised a thorough investigation and support for victims' families.

Boeing issued a statement saying the company is "in contact with Jeju Air and ready to support them."
