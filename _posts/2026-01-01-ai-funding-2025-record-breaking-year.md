The artificial intelligence sector dominated global venture capital in 2025, capturing close to 50% of all funding—up dramatically from 34% in 2024. A total of $202.3 billion was invested in AI companies, representing a 75% increase year over year.

## The Mega-Rounds That Defined 2025

The two largest foundation model companies, OpenAI and Anthropic, together captured an extraordinary 14% of global venture investment in 2025.

### OpenAI's Historic Valuation

OpenAI closed 2025 as the most valuable private company of all time, reaching a $500 billion valuation. The company's trajectory was defined by several landmark deals:

- **SoftBank's $40 billion investment** — the single largest deal of the year
- **Stargate joint venture** — a partnership with SoftBank and Oracle committing up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the U.S.
- Revenue projections targeting $30 billion in 2026, roughly double their 2025 figures

### Anthropic's Rapid Ascent

Anthropic, the AI safety-focused company behind Claude, secured its position as the fourth-most valuable private company at $183 billion:

- Closed $16.5 billion across two funding rounds in 2025
- Completed a $13 billion Series F led by Iconiq, Fidelity, and Lightspeed Venture Partners
- Signed a $30 billion deployment deal with Amazon for AWS integration
- Projects approximately $4.7 billion in revenue for 2025

## Infrastructure Race Intensifies

The hyperscalers have committed an estimated $300 billion-plus to AI capital expenditure in 2025, with increased commitments planned for 2026. Alphabet notably acquired Intersect, an energy and data center infrastructure provider, for $4.75 billion as it plans to lift compute spending to $93 billion in 2026.

## What's Next in 2026

Industry observers are watching whether leading model developers will continue raising tens of billions through equity investment, or if strategic partnerships will fill that gap. OpenAI is reportedly seeking to raise as much as $100 billion in the coming year.

The concentration of capital in a handful of AI companies raises questions about market dynamics and the sustainability of current valuations—particularly as competition intensifies between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google's rapidly advancing Gemini models.
